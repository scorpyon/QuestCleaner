# BOT_CLEAN

This is my neat little bot program I designed to make keeping the Quest thread tidy easier and quicker (and less painful).

The usage instructions are fairly simple.
NB - this app requires a Chrome Browser to run

1. Clone the Repo to your machine. (Ask me if you don't know how).
2. Navigate to the Release folder (BotClean/Bin/Release)
// WARNING - the next step will kill off any CHROME browsers you have open. Make sure you save anything you need)
3. Double click the BotClean App file.
4. Wait for the browser to finish loading and it takes you to the Twitch Login screen.
5. Log in. I can't automate this part, thanks to Twitch's anti-bot implementation.
6. Hit the Populate Ban List button. Watch the magic happen.
7. When that's finished, set how many pages you want to scan for banlist scammers (from the last page backwards)
8. Hit the Clean Thread button and go get a coffee. Or watch the fun.
