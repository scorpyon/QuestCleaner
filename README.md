# BOT_CLEAN

This is my neat little bot program I designed to make keeping the Quest thread tidy easier and quicker (and less painful).

The usage instructions are fairly simple.
NB - this app requires Chrome Browser installed to run

1. Clone the Repo to your machine. (Ask me if you don't know how).
2. Navigate to the Release folder (BotClean/Bin/Release)
3. Double click the BotClean App file.
4. Hit the Populate Ban List button. Watch the magic happen.
5. When that's finished, set how many pages you want to scan for banlist scammers (from the last page backwards)
6. Hit the Search Thread button and go get a coffee. Or watch the fun.
7. When the list is populated, click on a link to go to that page.
8. Right-Click-Remove to remove an item from the list (if needed)
